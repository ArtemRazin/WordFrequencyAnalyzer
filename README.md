# Word frequency analyzer

Here is a Python script that takes a set of text files, processes them to count the occurrences of each word, and produces a CSV file with the word counts, excluding words from a specified exclusion file.

First, ensure you have the following directory structure:

- text_files/
  - file1.txt
  - file2.txt
  - ...
- exclusion.txt

This will generate a word_count.csv file with the word counts excluding the specified words.
